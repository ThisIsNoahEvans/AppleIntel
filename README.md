# Apple Intel
An old page on Apple's website about the PPC>Intel transition - view it [here](https://apple-intel.itsnoahevans.co.uk)

## Please note:
I downloaded this web archive on the 8th of July. It sat on my laptop until late-August, when I found it and discovered that the original page has been removed from Apple's website. I then shared it here.

A version of this page is still available on Apple's website [here](https://www.apple.com/intel/index.html) but it's unclear how long it will last now [the old page](https://www.apple.com/sg/intel) has been removed.

I originally archived the Singapore version of the page - the page I was sent and that had `/sg/` in all URLs - but I have removed that for the standard `apple.com/` URLs.
