# Apple Intel
An old page on Apple's website about the PPC>Intel transition

# Please note:
I downloaded this web archive on the 8th of July. It sat on my laptop until late-August, when I found it and discovered that the original page has been removed from Apple's website. I then shared it here.

Also be aware, that as of now, the below section is not on the website. You can download a PDF version of the site - with the missing section - [here](https://apple-intel.itsnoahevans.co.uk/appleintel.pdf)

Feel free to re-add the image and create a PR before I have - I wanted to get this shared and out as soon as possible after I realised the original page had been taken down.
